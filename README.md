This repository demonstrates a common error in VBScript: insufficient error handling within functions.  The `bug.vbs` file contains a function with potential runtime errors that aren't comprehensively caught. The `bugSolution.vbs` file provides a more robust solution that addresses these shortcomings.  The issue highlights the importance of comprehensive error trapping for reliable VBScript code.
